# TABE25M

THIS ATOM PLUGIN WILL FORCE YOU TO __TAKE A BREAK EVERY 25 MINUTES.__ EACH BREAK LASTS 5 MINUTES. INSPIRED BY THE POMODORO TECHNIQUE.
I CREATED THIS PLUGIN BECAUSE I FOUND MYSELF CODING NONSTOP FOR HOURS.
THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY HABIT AND IT HURTS MY EYES, JUST LIKE A WALL OF ALL CAPITALIZED TEXT YOU ARE READING HERE.

## USAGE

### TYPING IN ATOM WILL SET A 25 MINUTES TIMER

### AS THE BREAK TIME APPROACHES, A REMINDER WILL APPEAR.

### THE REMINDER INTENSIFIES AS THE BREAK APPROACHES

### THEN IT COMPLETELY FILLS YOUR SCREEN, FORCING YOU TO TAKE A BREAK

### ALL ATOM WINDOWS ARE LOCKED AT THE SAME TIME, SO YOU CANNOT SWITCH TO ANOTHER WINDOW DURING THE BREAK.
